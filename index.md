## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University. I am interested in Cryptography; with special emphasis on Information-theoretic Cryptography and leakge resilient secret sharing. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/hmaji/">Hemanta Maji</a>. I received my B.S. in Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics from Purdue University.

Outside of my research, I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering#:~:text=Bouldering%20is%20a%20form%20of,use%20of%20ropes%20or%20harnesses.">bouldering</a>.
